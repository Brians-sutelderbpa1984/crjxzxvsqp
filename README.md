Just walked out of watching Dual, and I’m not sure if I’m tired from the film or just existentially exhausted? Maybe both. You’d think a movie about cloning would have, like, 87% more sci-fi madness, but this one’s more about the emotional baggage. I guess. What was I even expecting? Spaceship battles? Nope, just a mirror reflection giving you side-eye.

> Honestly, the whole “face your clone” thing felt like an argument with a funhouse mirror. It's the me but not me, and the whole time I’m thinking: if my clone was made, would it also hate broccoli or would it be one of those terrible, greens-eating versions of me? The horror.

There’s this tense, awkward thing going on – like a family reunion where no one wants to be there. The heroine meets her double, and my brain’s screaming: “Don’t you dare pull a Parent Trap.” Spoiler: there were zero traps but a fair share of intense stares. Also, I think the director has a secret fondness for long, uncomfortable silences. Is that an art form now? What do I know.

And the outfits! Why don't my clothes ever coordinate perfectly when I'm having an existential crisis? Like, can a person have a moral dilemma and still have their jacket match their jeans so well?

if (clone == stronger) {
    original->fight(clone);
}

Everything felt odd, like when you put cereal into milk and let it sit for too long. The pacing, emotions, dialogue—all a little soggy but in this bizarrely satisfying way, ya know? Might need to download the movie just to catch the nuanced glances between the characters again. Maybe they secretly blink in Morse code.

Honestly, maybe you have to watch the movie to fully grasp the bizarre soup of insanity. Or maybe just eat some broccoli and contemplate your clone now shoehorned into existence. Either option works.
